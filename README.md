# COSC360-Project

## Project Description

We are going to create a blogging website that will allow registered users to create their own blogs and edit them. Unregistered users will be allowed to view other people's blogs, but in order to comment (or create their own blogs), they will have to register on the website. Blog comments will be updated in real time.  

## Requirements

#### Unregistered Users

- Unable to comment, or post their own blogs. 
- Able to register using a prompt on the website.

#### Registered Users
